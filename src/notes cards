1. What is the Card Component?

The Card component is a simple presentation component that:

    Receives props (card, onClick, and isFlipped).
    Renders the card either face up (showing the image) or face down (showing the back side of the card) based on the isFlipped prop.

card: This prop is an object that contains information about the card (its image and name).
onClick: This prop is a function that gets executed when the user clicks the card. It will handle the logic for flipping cards, checking for matches, etc.
isFlipped: This boolean prop tells the Card component whether to show the card's front (image) or the back (hidden).

Step 1: Initial Render of the Card

    When the game first starts, each card component is rendered with:
        isFlipped = false (cards are not flipped initially).
        onClick function is passed, which contains the logic to handle the card click (to flip the card, check matches, etc.).
        The card object is passed, containing the card's image URL and name.
